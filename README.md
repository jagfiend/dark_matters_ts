# Dark Matters

This is a TypeScript rework of a game I built at uni.

To get started, clone this repo and run:

``yarn install && yarn run dev``

The project should then being running on http://localhost:5173/

## Todo 

1. slow the counter down with the fps setting 
2. move away from loops to map and filter 
3. move duplicate code into settings
